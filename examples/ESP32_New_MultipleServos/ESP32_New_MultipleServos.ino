  The ESP32, ESP32_S2, ESP32_S3, ESP32_C3 have two timer groups, TIMER_GROUP_0 and TIMER_GROUP_1
  1) each group of ESP32, ESP32_S2, ESP32_S3 has two general purpose hardware timers, TIMER_0 and TIMER_1
  2) each group of ESP32_C3 has ony one general purpose hardware timer, TIMER_0
  
  All the timers are based on 64-bit counters (except 54-bit counter for ESP32_S3 counter) and 16 bit prescalers. 
  The timer counters can be configured to count up or down and support automatic reload and software reload. 
  They can also generate alarms when they reach a specific value, defined by the software. 
  The value of the counter can be read by the software program.

  Now these new 16 ISR-based PWM servo contro uses only 1 hardware timer.
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

   This example will demonstrate the nearly perfect accuracy compared to software timers by printing the actual elapsed millisecs.
   Being ISR-based timers, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks, such as connecting to WiFi, Internet
   and Blynk services. You can also have many (up to 16) timers to use.
   This non-being-blocked important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.
   You'll see blynkTimer is blocked while connecting to WiFi / Internet / Blynk, and elapsed time is very unaccurate
   In this super simple example, you don't see much different after Blynk is connected, because of no competing task is

   Different servos require different pulse widths to vary servo angle, but the range is
   an approximately 500-2500 microsecond pulse every 20ms (50Hz). In general, hobbyist servos
   sweep 180 degrees, so the lowest number in the published range for a particular servo
   represents an angle of 0 degrees, the middle of the range represents 90 degrees, and the top
   of the range represents 180 degrees. So for example, if the range is 1000us to 2000us,
   1000us would equal an angle of 0, 1500us would equal 90 degrees, and 2000us would equal 1800
   degrees.

   Circuit:
   Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red,
   the ground wire is typically black or brown, and the signal wire is typically yellow,
   orange or white. Since the ESP32 can supply limited current at only 3.3V, and servos draw
   considerable power, we will connect servo power to the VBat pin of the ESP32 (located
   near the USB connector). THIS IS ONLY APPROPRIATE FOR SMALL SERVOS.

   We could also connect servo power to a separate external
   power source (as long as we connect all of the grounds (ESP32, servo, and external power).
   In this example, we just connect ESP32 ground to servo ground. The servo signal pins
   connect to any available GPIO pins on the ESP32 (in this example, we use pins
   22, 19, 23, & 18).

   In this example, we assume four Tower Pro SG90 small servos.
   The published min and max for this servo are 500 and 2400, respectively.
   These values actually drive the servos a little past 0 and 180, so
   if you are particular, adjust the min and max values to match your needs.
   Experimentally, 550 and 2350 are pretty close to 0 and 180.
