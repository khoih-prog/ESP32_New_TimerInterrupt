  ESP32_New_ISR_Servo.h
  For ESP32, ESP32_S2, ESP32_S3, ESP32_C3 boards with ESP32 core v2.0.0+

  The ESP32, ESP32_S2, ESP32_S3, ESP32_C3 have two timer groups, TIMER_GROUP_0 and TIMER_GROUP_1
  1) each group of ESP32, ESP32_S2, ESP32_S3 has two general purpose hardware timers, TIMER_0 and TIMER_1
  2) each group of ESP32_C3 has ony one general purpose hardware timer, TIMER_0
  
  All the timers are based on 64-bit counters (except 54-bit counter for ESP32_S3 counter) and 16 bit prescalers. 
  The timer counters can be configured to count up or down and support automatic reload and software reload. 
  They can also generate alarms when they reach a specific value, defined by the software. 
  The value of the counter can be read by the software program.

  Now these new 16 ISR-based PWM servo contro uses only 1 hardware timer.
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

  Based on SimpleTimer - A timer library for Arduino.
